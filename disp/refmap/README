Some games included in Blackthorn (for now, just Bunny Slayer) depend on the
REFMAP graphics set. Because of the licensing terms provided by REFMAP, the
graphics must be downloaded separately. A bash script has provided to automate
this process.

The REFMAP license is available at:
http://www.tekepon.net/fsm/modules/refmap/

The download script can be invoked with:
$ ./gettileset.sh
